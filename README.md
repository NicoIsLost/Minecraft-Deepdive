# What is Minecraft Deepdive?

Well, it's simply put, a deepdive into various technical minecraft topics. 

 > An exhaustive investigation, study, or analysis of a question or topic.

This is not meant to be a wiki, or an exhaustive list of all technical topics, but instead a currated list of topics that go into a high level of detail and are verified for accuracy by the community. 

## Why a GitHub Repo?
My hope is that through this Repo we can make these documents a community effort. ***_Anyone_*** is invited to fork and pull-request contributions or edits. 

This is truely meant to be a community effort, and we will accept any contributions that fit the topic area and level or detail and accuracy that are submitted. 

## What are the requirements?

There are few requirements, but on a general basis we would like articles to be as exhaustive as possible, going into detailed beyond the level of say a public wiki. It is also required that the information presented is accurate and verifiable. 

## Code Mappings Referances
One of the goals of this project is to also be a referance for people who are interested in code digging, as such we encourage people to add a section that explains the source code, including the mapping names and their functions. Per the minecraft TOS we cannot post the code itself, but a written decription is OK.

This is certaintly not nessesary, but something that is a goal and encouraged. 

**We would highly appreciate** anyone who is experianced in code-digging adding to existing articles to explain the methods and flow of the code for aspiring code-diggers.
